      <h2>Now</h2>

      <p>
        My name is <strong>George-Owen Damoyi-Bouridis</strong>. This page is my logbook and my corner of the internet.
        It’s part portfolio, part notebook, and part memory for future me. If I did something, it goes here.
        If I’m still learning, I’ll say that.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is called <strong>Noble Slate</strong> for a reason:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>George</strong> traces back to an old Greek root for “earth worker”.</li>
        <li><strong>Owen</strong> is linked to “well-born” or “noble”.</li>
        <li>
          A <strong>slate</strong> is a rock that holds a straight line under pressure, and a surface you can write on,
          erase, and write on again.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Put that together and you get how I want to work: steady, useful, and willing to rewrite things in public.
        That’s the point of this page.
      </p>

      <h2>Right now</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Rocket:</strong> I’m drafting a simple TVC model rocket I can recover cleanly.
        Two-servo gimbal sketches, a rough PID controller, an IMU short list, a first control loop draft, and a basic
        ground test plan are in progress. When things fail (they will), the failure notes will live here.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>VitaTrace:</strong> I’m sketching an early wearable health concept called VitaTrace.
        I’m writing a clear problem statement, a basic service flow, and some notes on privacy for Ontario.
        My dad died of pancreatic cancer when I was very young. That’s why I care about early signals and not just
        “sick vs not sick”.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Music:</strong> I’m getting more solid on tuba. I log breath work, long tones, and practice time,
        and rewrite notes so a beginner could follow them without wanting to quit.
      </p>

      <p><small>Last updated: 2025-10-30.</small></p>

      <p>
        I write pages in Markdown and publish plain HTML. Fast pages, high contrast, real alt text.
        I might write a short note later about how the site is built. For now, the content matters more than the tooling.
      </p>

      <p>
        When it exists, a more detailed running list will live on a <code>/now</code> page.
      </p>

      <h2>Old stuff</h2>

      <p>
        As I clean older notes, I’ll move them here under “Deprecated”. They’ll stay up, but I’ll mark clearly
        what I would do differently now.
      </p>

      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p>A few pieces of context:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grade 10 at Holy Trinity Catholic High School in Simcoe (Extended French).</li>
        <li>Air Cadets – 104 Starfighter.</li>
        <li>Student Council.</li>
        <li>A/V and morning announcements (soundboard, TriCaster, live events).</li>
        <li>Concert band – euphonium before, tuba now.</li>
        <li>English and French (bilingual enough to get into and out of trouble).</li>
        <li>Interests: aerospace medicine, robotics, physics, anatomy, and systems that fail under stress.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The short version: I’m trying to be steady, useful, and honest, and this site is my record of whether
        I’m actually doing that.
      </p>

      <h2>Footnotes</h2>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>George</strong> → from Greek <em>geōrgos</em> (“earth worker”, farmer).</li>
        <li><strong>Owen</strong> → often linked to Welsh <em>Owain</em> / Latin <em>Eugenius</em> (“well-born”, “noble”).</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Slate</strong> → a fine-grained metamorphic rock with slaty cleavage: it splits into thin, flat sheets
          that hold a straight edge. It has been used for roofing and classroom writing slates. The combination of
          pressure and rewriting is the part I care about.
        </li>
